Botrix is a plugin for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch that allows to play with bots.

Fast installation
=================
Unzip contents of zip file into  <SteamDir>/SteamApps/common/ folder. You should
have folder named "Half-Life 2 Deathmatch" there. This will extract botrix.dll
and place it inside "Half-Life 2 Deathmatch/hl2mp/bin" folder.
Launch Half-Life 2 Deathmatch with -insecure parameter (this is not required for
dedicated servers). Create new game, map dm_underpass. Type "botrix bot add"
several times at the console to create bots.

Have fun!


Custom installation
===================
As you may know Steam differs notions of GAME FOLDER (where hl2.exe is) and MOD
FOLDER (where gameinfo.txt is). Botrix plugin uses folder named "botrix" outside
of the GAME FOLDER, which is a BASE FOLDER to store configuration and waypoints.

Example of SINGLE-PLAYER GAME:
    Base folder (where all games are):
        C:/Steam/SteamApps/common
    Game folder:
        C:/Steam/SteamApps/common/Half-Life 2 Deathmatch/
    Mod folder:
        C:/Steam/SteamApps/common/Half-Life 2 Deathmatch/hl2mp/
    Botrix folder:
        C:/Steam/SteamApps/common/botrix

Example of DEDICATED SERVER:
    Base folder (where all dedicated servers are):
        C:/DedicatedServer/
    Game folder:
        C:/DedicatedServer/HL2DM/
    Mod folder:
        C:/DedicatedServer/HL2DM/hl2mp/
    Botrix folder:
        C:/DedicatedServer/botrix

Contents of this zip file should be extracted to the BASE FOLDER. If your game/
server is not under folder named "Half-Life 2 Deathmatch", but instead, say, in
folder "HL2DM", then you should move contents from folder "Half-Life 2
Deathmatch" (extracted from zip file) to folder "HL2DM". And also rename folder
"half-life 2 deathmatch" into "HL2DM" inside folder "botrix/waypoints", so
plugin can find waypoints files for your game. You should read configuration
section of this file to know how to configure your game/mod folders.

This plugin is UNSIGNED, so you need to execute hl2.exe with -insecure parameter
in single-player game. You can also set it by Steam, just right-click on the
game and select it's properties / set launch parameters or whatever.
Note that dedicated server doesn't need that.

For now waypoints were created for 2 maps: dm_underpass and dm_steamlab.
If you want to create waypoints use botrix commands to create and save them.
After doing that, send me your files, and I will make sure to test and publish
them on my site.

Any ideas are also appreciated, and if time will allow me, I could implement
them in future versions.

Please, feel free to send feedback to: botrix.plugin@gmail.com


Configuration
=============
Inside botrix folder there is a file: config.ini. Make sure that both game
folder and mod folder appear in section [HalfLife2Deathmatch.mod], under "games"
and "mods" keys.

For given example of SINGLE-PLAYER GAME you should have:
    games = Half-Life 2 Deathmatch
    mods = hl2mp

For given example of DEDICATED SERVER you should have:
    games = hl2dm
    mods = hl2mp

For DEDICATED SERVER there is a section in config.ini: [User access]. You
should read comments for that section to know how to add admins for Botrix.

Botrix should work with other mods, say Counter-Strike: Source. Check out
*.items.* and *.weapons sections to know how items and weapons are handled.
If you could make bots work for other mods, please send me your config file and
I will publish it on my site.


Limitations = future work
=========================
- Bots can't use manual weapons, grenades.
- During team play bots can stuck with each other.
- Bots can stuck with non breakable objects.
- Bots can't chat.
- Linux compilation.
- Remove useless commands for dedicated server.


Console commands
================
Every command in Botrix starts with "botrix".
At any time you can check for help of the command typing incomplete command (for
example just type botrix at the console to see available commands).
Note that some commands will not work on dedicated server (because text/line
drawing is a debug drawing, that can be done only on server side, it's not
transmitted to client side).

Waypoints commands

save waypoints in a file is "save", then complete command that user has to
introduce should be: "botrix waypoint save".
